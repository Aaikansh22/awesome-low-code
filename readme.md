### Integration Platform as a Service

A platform that help organizations control, simplify and standardize the way that applications are integrated (internally developed or 3rd party SaaS). Such platforms help to share data between applications, automate business workflows and remove manual error prone ones, in an advanced controlled manner. iPaaS also enables more types of personas to integrate applications, removing the constant dependency on software developers. iPaaS can be deployed within an organization either as a SaaS or as on-premises appliance.

### Robotic Process Automation

An automation platform that helps organizations remove human manual intensive processes and avoid errors, as well as making sure human required attention is efficiently maximized only on critical aspects of work. RPA technology introduced the concept of software robots, built by the end-user humans, to perform repetitive manual intensive processes in an automation fashion, and can understand and processes computer interactions with SaaS and on-premises applications just like a human-being. RPA technologies involve building, deploying, and managing those software robots.
